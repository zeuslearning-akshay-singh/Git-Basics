Hello Guy's, This File is Basically created to learn Git as well as practice the learned git cmd.
Hopefully their is nothing for you to see their as this file purpose was to try the cmd that i had learned

cmd

1. Initialize 
    - git init [Initialize the git for tracting the changes over the period of time]

2. Status
    - git status [it is used to Check the status of file such status of tracked file, untracked files and all]

3. Add 
    - git add . [Adds all the file to Staging Area]
    - git add file1.txt file2.txt file2.txt [To Add Multiple selected files to Staging Area]
    - git add file1.txt [To Add Single selected file to Staging Area]

4. Commit
    - git commit -m "Added file1.txt" [Add the file from Staging Area to Locally as Local Repo]
        * Here Above -m stands for message flag so that we can be aware of purpose of changes we made
        * And since project has no branch created and was just initailized without any code been pushed on serves so git will consider this as  master branch

5. Log
    - git log [Provides commit details]

6. Initial Project cmds
    - git remote add orgin https://github.com/MyLearnings.git
    - git branch -M main
    - git push -u orgin main

// 1st cmd adds remote server which named as origin as server of storing the code changes
// 2nd cmd is for creating branch as main and checkingout to that branch
// 3rd cmd is for pushing the code to remote server [i.e origin] with creating main branch and storing the changes on that branch

7. Git push
    - Once git default branch as origin or any other name is been defined then only running "git push" is sufficient

8. Git Clone
    - Via git clone we copy the pre-existing code from server
    - It has 2 uses 
        * a] Personal Purpose [To develop some personal functionality on that code] or 
        * b] Community Purpose [To contribute to open-source project]
    - git clone <git repo url> // Ignore this "< >" special symbol 
    - git clone <git repo url> <file name you want to provide rather than using default repo link>

    - since it is clone from other person repo then we wonb't be able to have access as write on the code
    - so, we would add our own new created repo 
    [
        # Note: while running cmd git remote add origin <url> do make sur to change the name default name og "origin" as while cloning origin was already been assigned
        and then follow with creating branch and pushing the code with new deafult variable name [e.g git push -u newOrigin]
        Remember this is just one time change and on next time you just need to hit this [git push] cmd
    ]

9. Git Ignore
    - File that conatins list files either mentioned directly or been add using shortcut rules are ignored [i.e not get tracked] by git
    - Use of this ".gitignore" file is that we do often have some file that we don't want to get tracked by git 
    - For E.g. => there may be some output file that was been generated while compiling of the programe or like node module project has node_module folder that is big as well as can be ignored
