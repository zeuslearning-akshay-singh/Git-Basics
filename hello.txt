Hello Guy's, This File is Basically created to learn Git as well as practice the learned git cmd.
Hopefully their is nothing for you to see their as this file purpose was to try the cmd that i had learned

cmd

1. Initialize 
    - git init [Initialize the git for tracting the changes over the period of time]

2. Status
    - git status [it is used to Check the status of file such status of tracked file, untracked files and all]

3. Add 
    - git add . [Adds all the file to Staging Area]
    - git add file1.txt file2.txt file2.txt [To Add Multiple selected files to Staging Area]
    - git add file1.txt [To Add Single selected file to Staging Area]

4. Commit
    - git commit -m "Added file1.txt" [Add the file from Staging Area to Locally as Local Repo]
        * Here Above -m stands for message flag so that we can be aware of purpose of changes we made
        * And since project has no branch created and was just initailized without any code been pushed on serves so git will consider this as  master branch

5. Log
    - git log [Provides commit details]

6. Initial Project cmds
    - git add remote orgin https://github.com/MyLearnings.git
    - git branch -M main
    - git push -u orgin main

// 1st cmd adds remote server which named as origin as server of storing the code changes
// 2nd cmd is for creating branch as main and checkingout to that branch
// 3rd cmd is for pushing the code to remote server [i.e origin] with creating main branch and storing the changes on that branch
